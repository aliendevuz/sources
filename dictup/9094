THE MAGIC COMPUTER
I had a difficult geography project to finish by the end of the semester. My teacher wanted it to be typewritten, so I went to the school computer room. But when I got there, all the computers were turned off. Apparently there was a recent problem, and technicians were fixing it.

I knew of some private study rooms downstairs. They were small and dark, and the computers were very old, but I had no choice. At least the computers were operating correctly. I typed and highlighted the assignment’s title: “Evaluate the Government’s Response to Global Warming.” But I didn’t know what to write in my essay. Finally I decided to find a book to help me. I went to the library, checked the book indexes and eventually found a useful book. Then I returned to the computer.

When I looked at the screen, I saw something so weird that I nearly fainted! The essay was complete! Had somebody in cyberspace written it? I didn’t know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an “A.”

After that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I’d type the title, wait awhile, and the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything. I stopped paying attention to my teacher’s lectures and spent my extra time in the gymnasium. And my grades got better and better.

A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, “Are you prepared for the test?”

“What test?” I asked.

“The geography test!” he replied. “I hope you studied. It’s worth seventy percent of our final grade!”

I failed the test, of course. I was completely ignorant about the subject. After that, I made a resolution never to use the magic computer again. The moral of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won’t learn anything.
