THE TRAVELER AND THE INNKEEPER
A traveler stopped at an inn. He sat and watched people closely, like a predator. He heard the old innkeeper talking to a young man in the core of the inn.

“I just need to borrow some money. I swear that I’ll spend it in moderation, and my friend will pay you back tomorrow,” the man said. The innkeeper gave his consent and pulled out some money.

The traveler knew that this was a trick. The man was going to leave with the poor innkeeper’s money and never return. He felt compassion for the nice innkeeper and did not want him to be tricked. The cunning traveler decided to teach the innkeeper a lesson.

The traveler walked over to the innkeeper and sat down. The innkeeper had started to grind coffee beans to make coffee. He made the coffee and handed the traveler a saucer and a cup. The two started talking. After a while the traveler yawned and then growled like a wolf.

“Are you not sane? I thought I just heard you growl,” said the innkeeper.

“I did. I am cursed. Every time I yawn three times in a row, I turn into a wolf and attack people.”

The innkeeper became tense. Then the traveler yawned again. As the traveler started to yawn a third time, the innkeeper turned to run outside. As he ran, the traveler snatched his coat. The scared innkeeper staggered outside and tumbled into the street.

The traveler followed him out because he did not want to withhold the truth any longer. He just wanted to foster happiness and restore the innkeeper’s emotional equilibrium. The innkeeper was dizzy, and he stumbled. The traveler helped him stand up.

“That was a trick,” the traveler said as he returned the coat.

“Oh, good. I cherish this coat,” responded the innkeeper.

“Well, hopefully this will teach you that you shouldn’t believe every story that you hear.”
