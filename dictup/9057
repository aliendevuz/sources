THE FISHERMAN
Every day, a fisherman sat on a bridge. He ate apples and spit the seeds into the water. He had a simple way to catch fish. He cut a branch off of a tree and tied a line to it. He put a sharp hook on it and made a tight knot. Then he whispered, “Come here fish.” Like magic, the fish bit the hook. He put them in a big net and took them home to make big pots of fish soup from them.

One day, another man walked up to him. He said, “My name is George. I am staying at the inn. I bet that I am a better fisherman than you. I will accompany you today. I dare you to prove your skill!” The fisherman cast his line.

George had a lot of electronic tools. One machine gave him the virtual locations offish. His rod weighed fish.

At the end of the day, George subtracted his fish from the fisherman’s. The fisherman had beaten him by forty-seven!

George asked, “How do you catch fish with only a branch and a bare line? I have many different sorts of tools.” The fisherman told George, “My philosophy is simple. I am patient, and I believe in myself. Take a breath, and try it my way.”
