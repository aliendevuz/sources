THE CRIMINAL
A man had been in jail because he stole things. The criminal never felt bad. One day, he escaped and ran into the woods. He found a cabin with a fence. The cabin was very neat. Inside, the criminal found a bowl of fruit, a bottle of milk, and a dozen eggs. He ate the fruit and drank the milk. But the eggs smelled funny, so he put them in the trash bin. Soon, he heard the sound of a vehicle’s motor.

An old man came in and saw the criminal. The old man yelled, “Why are you in my house?” The criminal lied, “I am a policeman.” The old man replied, “I am your elder. You cannot fool me. You are the criminal.” The criminal’s facial expression became very sad.

He admitted that he was a criminal. He said, “I’m sorry. It was rude for me to come into your home. Please take the cash from my wallet. It is a mere amount, but it will settle our problem.” The old man said, “I do not want your money. I just want to inspire you to be good. There will be no penalty for taking my food.”

On this occasion, the criminal realized that he had been bad. He listened to the old man and never stole from anyone ever again.
