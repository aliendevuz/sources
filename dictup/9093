THE TRICKY FOX
There was a fox that lived in the forest. Fox loved to play mean tricks on the other animals. One day, he used the sharp rim of a bottle to dig a pit in the ground. He hid in a tree until Rabbit came to the pit’s edge. Then, he jumped out and pushed Rabbit into the pit. Fox laughed and ran away. The angry Rabbit climbed out and told the other animals what happened.

The others said, “That is typical behavior for Fox. He does mean things all the time. Sometimes, he is completely immoral. We all disapprove of his actions, so we should teach him a lesson. Tomorrow, we’ll push Fox into that pit.”

The next day, all of the animals hid near the pit and waited for Fox. Fox was oblivious to the hidden animals. He walked up to the pit to see if Rabbit was still trapped. Just then, the other animals ran up to Fox and pushed him in. All the animals laughed and cheered, except Fox, of course.

Fox couldn’t get out! The walls of the pit were covered in damp ivy. It was too slippery for him to climb out. He was utterly helpless. He moaned and began to weep.

At last, he saw Eagle watching him from her roost. He yelled, “Eagle, please help me! If I don’t get out of here, I will perish!”

Eagle said, “You may think your tricks are trivial, but you hurt others when you do mean things. I’ll help you if you promise to be nice.”

Fox said, “I promise!”

Eagle began her flight to the bottom of the pit. She picked up Fox with her beak and soared out of the pit. She dropped Fox safely on the ground.

Fox thanked Eagle and kept his promise. He was nice to the other animals. The animals even became fond of Fox, and the forest was happy place.
