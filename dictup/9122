THE BACHELOR’S LESSON
A keen young bachelor had finished his studies at the university. As soon as he had received his diploma, he asserted to everyone he met that he was the smartest person in town.

“I excel at everything I study,” he said, bragging about his knowledge. “I’ve mastered calculus and physiology. I even understand the great theoretical teachings of science, such as relativity. There is nothing that I don’t know. Whether it’s the movements of celestial objects, like planets and stars, or how to harness the power of radioactive substances, I know everything.”

But actually, there was something the bachelor did not know. Though his analytic abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.

One day while walking through town, the bachelor witnessed a collision between two cars. Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.

He thought to himself, “Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very competent.” He never thought the drivers needed help.

“Please help me,” said the female driver in a weak voice. “Help me, too,” said the male driver. “I’m hurt and can’t move.”

Suddenly the bachelor realized he was the only person near the accident. He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers. He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.

The drivers were saved, and the bachelor felt the best he had in his entire life. Studying mythology, sociology, and geology didn’t give him this wonderful feeling. It was the act of helping others, not his cognitive skills, that gave him this great feeling.

He had learned an important lesson. He learned that intellect isn’t everything; being helpful is just as important. “Having only a brain is not enough,” he thought. “You must also have a heart.”
