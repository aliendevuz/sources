THE DOCTOR’S CURE
James Fry was a fantastic doctor. His surgeries helped many disabled people overcome their injuries. He also wrote for a popular medical journal. James was very busy. His son, Steve, rarely saw him.

One day, James was walking and inspecting a patient’s file. There was water all over the floor. James slipped on the liquid and fell. He fell on a broken glass tube. He was hurt.

Steve came to visit him in the hospital. James said, “It will be tough for me to stay in bed. But I can hardly bend my legs.”

“Then let’s watch a movie.” Steve said. It made them laugh together. Steve said, “I have to leave, but here’s some fiction to read.”

James started to recall fun parts of life. He marveled at small things, like food. He was too busy to notice them before. “Steve,” he said, “you get more nutrients when you chew slowly. But I think it makes food taste better, too!”

Weeks later, James said, “Steve, I haven’t spent enough time with you. I regret this. Even my soul feels better when you visit. But I have spent sufficient time here. We should go home.”

Outside, there was a warm breeze. James watched a flag blow.

Finally, James said, “I’m not ready to work. I’m going to take a long bath. And then we’ll watch a movie together.”
