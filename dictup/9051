THE FARM FESTIVAL
Once there was a farm. Many animals lived there. One day, they had a contest in the yard. They were going to race from the barn to the farmer’s garage. The barn and the garage were far apart. It would be a long race. The winner qualified to win a bag full of apples as an award.

But the race did not start well. The cart with all the apples was not stable, and the animals had to repair it. Then the pup knocked over the apples. The pig yelled, “We are going to slip! We must clean up this mess.” The pup felt bad, and she began to cry. The dog gave her a tissue to wipe her tears.

Then the race resumed. But the duck tried to rob them and take all the apples. The cat said, “I will have you arrested!” The duck said, “You can’t convict me! You can’t prove I took it.” The race stopped yet again.

The animals tried to race one more time. Then they heard an alarm coming from the barn. There was a fire! They got buckets of water to put out the fire. A journalist came to write a story about the festival and the race. The horse told her, “I am a special breed of horse. I would have won the race easily.” The pig said, “It was somewhat hard to have the race. But we had fun. That is what’s important!”
