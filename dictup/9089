THE KITTEN AND THE CATERPILLAR
Katie the kitten liked to play. One day, Cory the caterpillar emerged from a hole in the wall while Katie was playing in the living room.

“ Hey!” Katie yelled. “ Do you want to play with me?”

Cory was reluctant. He said, “ I’d rather not play with you. I have several handicaps. My body is very delicate. Your claws are as sharp as hooks. You might cut me. Plus, I have no bones, not even a spine. You could easily hurt me.”

“ I swear that I won’t hurt you,” Katie said.

“ No, I don’t want to,” he said again. He hopped from the wall, but Katie pursued him.

Cory ran into the kitchen and into the cupboard, but Katie chased closely behind. Katie knocked appliances to the floor. Plates fell into the sink and broke in the basin.

Then he ran into a bedroom. Some laundry was on the floor. Cory hid under a shirt, but Katie saw him. She jumped on the shirt. Her paws left stains on the cloth, and her claws ripped the sleeves into strips.

However, Cory escaped. He utilized a small crack in the floor to hide. But Katie saw him.

“ Now you are trapped!” said Katie.

Cory tried to avoid Katie’s claws. He moved his body as far into the hole as possible. He didn’t know how he’d get out of the hole.

Just then, Katie’s owner came home. She saw that the house was a mess. She took a broom and swung it at Katie. She chased Katie out of the house.

Cory was safe, and Katie was left outside because she didn’t listen to the wishes of others.
