THE TAXI DRIVER
Peter’s job was driving a taxi downtown. He made a small salary. But he liked his job because it wasn’t dull. Every day, he saw new things that appealed to him. Peter was practical about the future. “Maybe I can get a scholarship to college,” he thought. “I could learn mathematical formulas and get a job at a bank. I could help clients invest their money.”

Peter stopped to pick up a passenger. “Where to?” he asked.

“Go to the Fourth Street Bank. And don’t talk to me. I’ve had a rough day,” the man said. Peter was angry, but he had a peaceful philosophy. When they stopped, the man’s fare came to $10.25. He put his hands in his pockets. “I can’t find my wallet!” he said. “I can’t pay the fare!”

Peter said, “Maybe I’ll give you a temporary loan. You can borrow ten dollars and a quarter from me.”

The man was embarrassed, saying, “I was mean to you, but now I want to help you. I founded this bank. I want to give you one thousand dollars.”

That much money was like a treasure to Peter. The man urged him to take the money, but he didn’t.

“You’re an honest person,” the man said. “I assumed you would take it. I want you to work for me.”

The next day, Peter started his job at the bank. He was happy to be done with his former job.
