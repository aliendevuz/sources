THE OLD MAN WITH A BUMP
An old man had a large bump on his face. He went to the best physician in town. He gave the old man tragic news: “ I can’t do anything. You’ll have to get accustomed to it.”

One day, the old man went into the forest. Suddenly, the light became dim. It was going to rain. So he found a hollow tree to sit under. It leaked a little, but there was no other place he could wait.

When the rain stopped, his joints felt stiff from sitting. Suddenly, he heard a tune coming from far away. Many fables said monsters lived in the forest. No one could affirm that the stories were true, though. Still, his instincts told him that there was something out there. He walked farther into the forest. Then he saw a fire glowing. He was astonished to see a clan of monsters. They were having a great feast and banging on drums.

He stood behind a tree, spying on them. Then the leader asked, “ Who’s the best dancer here?”

“ Me!” the man yelled, coming from behind the tree. He started to dance. When he was finished, the leader said, “ I want you to dance every night. In order to make sure you return, I’m going to keep something you love.”

“ Please don’t take my bump,” he begged. “ I can’t sacrifice it. It’s good luck!” He exclaimed, pointing at it for emphasis.

The monsters agreed that they had to take his bump. After they did, the man stroked his face to make sure it was gone. He had tricked them! He never went back, and he never had to worry about his bump again.
