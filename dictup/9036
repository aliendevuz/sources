A BEAUTIFUL BIRD
Dr. Norton’s occupation was a scholar of biology. He learned about all animals on a daily basis. One day he met a sailor from a colony overseas. The man told Dr. Norton about a talking bird! The bird fascinated Dr. Norton, so he told his colleagues about it. They debated with him: no one thought a bird could talk. He tried to persuade them, but they laughed at him. Nevertheless, Dr. Norton believed the bird was real. His new mission was to find it. He wanted factual proof.

The next day he departed for the colony. The sailor he had met told him to look for a man named Jai, who would be able to help him in his search. After a month of sailing, Dr. Norton finally reached the colony where he met Jai.

“I can take you to where it lives. It lives by the volcano,” Jai said. They left the next day. A week later, they arrived at the volcano. Every day they walked around and looked for the bird, but they couldn’t find it. After one month, Dr. Norton could not find the bird, and this depressed him. He decided to go home. On the route back, he walked past some old ruins. He heard someone say, “Hello.”

“Who are you?” he asked. Dr. Norton looked up and saw a bird!

Dr. Norton put the talking bird into a cage. Then he returned home. He had made a significant discovery.
