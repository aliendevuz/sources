MRS. MAY AND THE GREEN GIRL
One morning, people from a small town found a little girl by a stream. She seemed to be wearing a green costume. As the people got closer, they saw that the girl’s skin was green!

“Oh my!” The people exclaimed. “What if her motive for coming to our town is bad? What if she has a strange origin?”

An old woman kindly went to her. “Look how scared she is. Please,” she begged. “Do not reject her. I will adopt her.”

There was silence until the judge spoke. “I don’t know,” he said in a worried tone. “But we cannot forbid you. I indeed hope you’re not being a fool.”

Mrs. May extended her hand to the girl. “Come with me. I won’t hurt you.”

The girl spoke a language Mrs. May didn’t know. But she was able to interpret what the girl was trying to say. Sometimes the girl drew pictures to illustrate what she meant.

The green girl was from a place far beyond the sun. There, people lived in nests built in trees. They only ate green leaves, which made their skin green.

“Well, you can’t just eat leaves,” Mrs. May said. She fed the green girl home-cooked meals, and soon the girl wasn’t green anymore. The people had a huge reception to welcome her as a citizen of the town.
