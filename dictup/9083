THE BREMEN TOWN MUSICIANS
Larry the cow, Harry the rooster and Lester the duck lived on a widow’s farm. They dreamed of playing music in a parade.

One day, the widow went to the lawn where her herd of cattle was grazing. “ I’ll eat him tomorrow,” she said, pointing to Larry.

Larry wanted to flee, but he didn’t have the nerve to go by himself. Then his friends Lester and Harry showed him a poster.

“ It’s for a parade in Bremen. We’ll go with you, and we can perform our symphony there,” Lester said.

The animals put together a small bundle that held a drum, a flute and a portable microphone. Then they took their baggage and initiated their long journey.

They walked down a paved lane all day. That night, they looked in the window of a house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories about their greed and the people they stole from.

Lester was an optimist. He said, “ I think we can scare them away!”

Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked over the lamp. “ What was that?” screamed a thief as the bulb broke. They could barely see now.

Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But Harry flew over them and scratched them.

“ It’s a phantom!” yelled one thief.

The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, “Why go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!” And so they remained there and were quite happy.
