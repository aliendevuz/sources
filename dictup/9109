THE BETRAYAL
A king lived in a fort with his daughter, Clara. The king had founded a great empire, but his land was rife with enemies who wanted to take over the kingdom. Because there was so much civil unrest, the king told Clara not to trust anyone.

One day, Clara was walking outside when she saw a girl sweeping the path. Clara crossed the garden, and they started talking. The girl’s name was Susie. Clara felt sorry for Susie because she was very poor, and Clara gave her a bracelet. After that, Susie and Clara met every day.

Once, the King saw them talking. He told Clara, “Don’t talk to that girl. She could be an enemy.”

“You can’t distrust everyone,” commented Clara. “She is my sole friend. It’s OK to be friendly to people.”

The King said, “Don’t argue with me. Stay inside from now on, and talk to no one.”

Clara felt lonely in the fort. But one day she saw Susie outside. She wrote her a note with a map showing a secret entrance to the fort. Clara wrote: “Come at night, and we can talk together. Don’t show anybody this note.” She threw the note to Susie, and Susie tucked it in the lining of her dress.

That night Clara waited for Susie. But she heard something ticking, and then a loud blast. She ran into the hall, and it was full of smoke, which made her choke. A mass of soldiers were there, fighting. Clara realized that Susie had betrayed her and given the map to her father’s enemies. Clara prayed that everyone in the castle would be safe from her friend’s treachery.

At last, the fighting ceased. Clara found her father in the hall with his soldiers. They had defeated their enemies, but there were dents in their armor from the heavy fighting. Clara told her father what she had done and promised never to disobey him again.
