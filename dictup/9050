FROM THE EARTH TO THE STARS
Jeremy was from a family of miners. Like them, he worked underground during the day. His job was to gather raw minerals and jewels. Each night after work, he lay awake in an open field. With his telescope, he looked at the stars. He was amazed by the scale of space. He wished someday he might travel there.

One day there was an accident in the mine. Water poured into the mine. Everything was dark. Jeremy stretched out and grabbed a piece of wood. It kept him from sinking. Jeremy felt a presence nearby.

“I am an angel,” said a voice.

“What?” Jeremy exclaimed.

“You must never come underground again. Have the courage to make your wishes come true.”

For a long time he floated in silence. Then he heard other voices. The other miners were coming to rescue him.

The next day Jeremy skipped work. He decided to become an astronaut. For the next two years, he studied hard. One day, he was given permission to participate in a mission to space. His wish had been granted.

His spaceship left the ground. It went higher until there was no more gravity. He saw satellites floating next to the ship.

Then Jeremy saw a beautiful angel outside his spaceship. It smiled at Jeremy. For some minutes, Jeremy could not speak. Finally, he said, “Thankyou.”
