PETER AND THE DWARF
Peter was a hunter. One day, he was in pursuit of a deer and became lost. He usually carried a compass with him when he went into the wilderness, but that day he left it at home.

As he walked, the forest began to look different. He didn’t see any bamboo. Instead, there were bushes with long leaves. The ecosystem was now very abnormal. Peter knew he was in the Magic Marsh.

Now he was tired and thirsty. He was afraid. Being lost in the marsh could be fatal. When people entered it, they never came out.

At last, he found a pond. Flowers grew around it. The blossoms smelled like the best perfume. He felt relaxed so he drank some water and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw an evil dwarf staring at him.

“ What are you doing here?” it asked. The dwarf spoke in a strange dialect.

“ I’m lost,” said Peter. “ Can you help me?”

“Yes,” it said, but Peter didn’t know it was dishonest.

The dwarf took an old manuscript from his pocket. It was a magic map. “ Just recite the words at the bottom,” the dwarf explained. “ It will show you how to get home.”

“ Good,” Peter said. He was impatient and quickly grabbed the map.

He recited the magic words, and a line appeared on the map. He walked for many days but never left the marsh. Finally, the map led him back to the pond. He walked in a circle!

The dwarf was still there. “ Here’s a proverb for you to think about,” it said, “ When patience is lost, the so are you.”
