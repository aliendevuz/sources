BLACKBEARD
A longtime ago, I had my first job. It didn’t give me much of an income. It was on a giant pirate ship. On my first night, there was a thick fog over the water. A lamp on the ship revealed an enormous man. He had a sword in his belt. His name was Blackbeard, and he was one of the most violent pirates ever.

One day, Blackbeard did an extraordinary thing. He attacked several ships near a town. He took some of the town’s citizens. Then he declared, “You give me medicine!” Blackbeard wanted the medicine for some of the sick pirates on his ship.

The people had a bad impression of him. They were mad, and they resisted. But they were trapped. They wanted to get rid of him. So the town’s council decided to give him the medicine.

After this, there was a reward for catching Blackbeard. If Blackbeard was caught, he would have a trial. He didn’t want to go to jail, so he quit being a pirate.

Blackbeard became a fisherman. But he ought to have stayed on land. The Royal Navy was still looking for him. They attacked him while he was fishing on his boat. Blackbeard fought against many men. Finally, he was killed. He didn’t even get a funeral. But people still tell tales about him many years later.
